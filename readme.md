# Payvision calculator

My tasks in this exercise were: 
1) maintainance and new features development
2) code review
3) fix bugs in the app
4) think about testing my app
5) improve UX/UI

### 1. Code review and new features
I've decided to implement 3 new features (multiply and divide operations, changes on clear button). 
I've stuctured comments in a code, explaning what each block of code is doing and what changes I've made. 

### 2. Testing and bug fixing
After fixing a few obvious bgs (such as + - signs, 0 and 3 numbers were switched), I've implemented some basic testing with Jest. 
I believe, that writing tests is essential and do save time when they are correctly implemented.
Our app is quite small, 
### 3. New features implementation

Our product owner required us new features for this application. We would like the application new version to support multiplications and divisions.

- Could you implement these new features?
- Bear in mind usage of git-flow to track your changes.
- Current version is 1.2.2 (see package.json version). Should we increase the version? How? Why?

### 4. Test automation

We would like to automate testing of this application.

- What kind of tests would you implement? Why?

**Bonus**: Implement the tests.

### 5. UI/UX design

Do you consider yourself a good designer or UI/UX developer?

- Improve the UI/UX to be more user friendly.

Feel free to do any changes. Show us what you are capable to!

## How to run the application using local server

To run the project, open a terminal and execute the following command from project root path:

- Install depencencies:

> yarn

- Run the application

> yarn serve

This command will run a local web server in port 8082:
[http://localhost:8082/src/index.html](http://localhost:8082/src/index.html)
